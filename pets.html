    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-600">Protecting your pets from worsening air quality</h1>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Air quality is affected by vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and improper waste disposal. These pollutants don't just affect humans; they significantly impact our pets.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-blue-500">Why Does It Happen?</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">Human activities such as excessive use of vehicles and industries release harmful pollutants into the air. Natural factors like dust storms also play a role. Pets, especially dogs and cats, are often closer to the ground, inhaling higher concentrations of these pollutants. Additionally, their respiratory systems can be more sensitive than ours.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-blue-500">How Does It Affect our pets?</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">Poor air quality can cause respiratory problems like coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing in pets. It can also lead to eye and skin irritation, and exacerbate existing heart conditions. Long-term exposure can contribute to chronic illnesses, and can be especially dangerous for senior pets or those with pre-existing conditions.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-blue-500">Preventions</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
        <strong>Limit Outdoor Exposure:</strong> On days with poor air quality alerts, reduce the time your pets spend outdoors. Schedule walks for early mornings or late evenings when pollution levels are typically lower. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Monitor Air Quality:</strong> Stay informed about local air quality indexes. Use apps or websites that provide real-time data. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Provide a Clean Indoor Environment:</strong> Use air purifiers with HEPA filters to remove pollutants from indoor air. Regularly vacuum and dust your home. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Avoid Strenuous Activity:</strong> Limit intense exercise during periods of poor air quality. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Keep Pets Hydrated:</strong> Ensure your pets have access to fresh, clean water. Hydration helps support their respiratory system. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Be Aware of Symptoms:</strong> Watch for signs of respiratory distress, such as coughing, wheezing, rapid breathing, or lethargy. If you notice any of these symptoms, consult your veterinarian immediately. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Avoid Smoke and Irritants:</strong> Refrain from smoking indoors or near your pets. Avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaning products that emit strong fumes. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Provide Shelter:</strong> If your pet spends time outdoors, ensure they have access to a sheltered area where they can escape from dust and pollutants.
